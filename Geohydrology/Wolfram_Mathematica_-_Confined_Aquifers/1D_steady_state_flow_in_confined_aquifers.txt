Assignment: Write a program in MATLAB or python to solve the 1-D steady-state flow in a confined aquifer using Laplace equation with boundary conditions.";

"Laplace equation: âˆ‡^2[h(x, y, z)] = 0 

In 1-Dimension, it reduces to: d^2[h(x)]/dx^2 = 0

Boundary Conditions:

1.) At x = 0, h(x) = h1 ----- h(0) = h1
2.) At x = L, h(x) = h2 ----- h(L) = h2

Solving the differential equation with boundary conditions:"
In[30]:= DSolve[{h''[x]==0,h[0]==h1,h[L]==h2},h[x],x]
Out[30]= {{h[x]->(h1 L-h1 x+h2 x)/L}}
In[33]:= "Hence, the simplified solution is : h(x) = h1 + ((h2 - h1) * x)/L.

Now, according to Darcy's law:";
In[75]:=  q =-k * h'[x];

"But:";

h'[x]=(h2 - h1)/L;

"Hence, q =";q
Out[78]= -(((-h1+h2) k)/L)
